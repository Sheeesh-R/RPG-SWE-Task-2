Available Commands:
==================
• move <direction>     - Move to another area (e.g., 'move east')
• pick up <item>       - Pick up an item (e.g., 'pick up tool')
• use tool            - Use the diagnostic tool on the maintenance droid
• status              - View your current status and inventory
• win                 - Complete the mission (requires energy crystal in Docking Bay)
• help                - Display this help message
• quit                - Exit the game

Tips:
• Commands are case-insensitive
• You can use 'tool' instead of 'diagnostic tool' and 'crystal' instead of 'energy crystal'
• Explore the station and discover what needs to be done!
